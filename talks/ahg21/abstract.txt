Title: Automated Generation of Tactile Mathematics


-----------------------------------------------------------
Length: 1h

-----------------------------------------------------------
Type: Lecture

-----------------------------------------------------------
Presentation Summary:

We present a workflow for the generation of tactile mathematical content from
commonly used mathematical markup. The workflow exclusively employs freely
available open source tools and results in embossable output that is a
combination of literary Braille and Nemeth Code together with diagrams set as
tactile graphics.

Presentation Abstract:

The generation of mathematical content in tactile form is a time consuming and
often expensive process. We will present a workflow for the automated
transcription of mathematical textbooks and course material into tactile
formats.  The workflow is based on a combination of open source tools and
facilitates translation of common math markup into literary Braille and Nemeth
Code. In particular, its input is based on PreTeXt, a highly structured XML
markup containing mathematical formulas in LaTeX, which is commonly used for
open education resources in mathematics. To generate tactile output we employ
LibLouis for literary Braille together with MathJax and Speech Rule Engine for
translating formulas to Nemeth.  While the result can be sent directly to an
embosser, we also provide support for proof reading and correction of the Nemeth
output as well as techniques to automatically turn mathematical diagrams into
tactile graphics.

-----------------------------------------------------------

Key Point 1 *: Automated generation of tactile teaching material in mathematics can reduce your workload
Key Point 2 *: The high quality transcription of LaTeX Math to Nemeth Braille is a key factor
Key Point 3 *: Creation of tactile mathematical graphics can be supported and automated

Volker is Professor in Document Analysis and Accessibility at the University of
Birmingham, UK and Adjunct Faculty at IIT Delhi, India. He is working primarily
on diagram recognition, mathematical document analysis and handwriting
recognition. Practical applications of his research include STEM accessibility
with a particular focus on Web technologies and eBooks.  He has been working as
a Visiting Scientist with Google on math integration into ChromeVox. He is a
member of the MathJax consortium responsible for the integration of accessible
rendering of mathematical formulas on the web. And with his company Progressive
Accessibility Solutions, he concentrates on accessibility technology that
exploits image analysis to generate accessible STEM diagrams.
